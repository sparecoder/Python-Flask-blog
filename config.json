        "about_text": "Hi I am Vikramaditya Singh, just an extrovert who stumbled upon coding and developed an interest for it. So, I won't go into any of the technical boring stuff because you are in the about me section.\n Growing up I was interested in tech I binged through various youtube channels like MKBHD and Tech Burner and also tried to build projects in my summer vacations with my friend, back when I was a kid I dreamed of being an astronaut wanting to go to outer space, never dreamed of being a coder. So how did I end up here, Well my school introduced me to coding in class 11 and I wouldn't say I liked it from the start but I developed an interest for it which led me to pursue my bachelors in engineering from KIIT, Bhubaneshwar.",
